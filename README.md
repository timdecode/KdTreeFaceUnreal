# KdTreeFaceUnreal
A Kd face tree for Unreal Engine 4, that enables very fast nearest-point-to-mesh queries.

The code is based on [kdtree_face.h](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib/blob/master/vcg/space/index/kdtree/kdtree_face.h) from the [Visual and Computer Graphics Library.](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib)

The [license is the VCG License,](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) which is the GPL. I'm sorry.
